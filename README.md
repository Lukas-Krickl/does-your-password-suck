# does-your-password-suck
A simple static webapp for checking advanced password strength.

Beyond simple character and length checks, the password is also scanned for:
+ english/german words which create attack surface for dictionary attacks
+ if this password already has been leaked, which creates a vulnerability when attackers use leaked or popular passwords
as the source of dictionary attacks.
